# GEMINI Context

This file serves as a memory aid for the AI assistant (Gemini/Antigravity) working on this project.

## Project Scope
- Flatten Gear Tracker for SAO: Hollow Realization.
- Stack: Flutter (Mobile Only - Android/iOS).
- Database: Isar (Local persistence).
- State Management: Flutter Riverpod.

## Current Status
- Project scaffolding in progress.
- Requirements defined in `specs/requirements.md`.

## Key Commands
- `$HOME$/lib/flutterSDK/bin/flutter run`: Run the app.
- `$HOME$/lib/flutterSDK/bin/dart run build_runner build`: Generate code for Isar/Riverpod.
- **Wireless Debugging**: Supported on Android 11+ via `adb pair` or Android Studio (see `SIDELOADING.md`).

## Design Philosophy
- "Aincrad" Aesthetic: Light, clean, slightly futuristic/MMORPG UI. Menus like the game implementation (Orange/Yellow accents, white backgrounds/transparent panels).

## Next Steps
1. Setup Isar models.
2. Build logic for "Best Upgrade" calculation.
